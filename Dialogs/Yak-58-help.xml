See "Equipment/Fuel and Payload" menu to adjust aircraft weights. Being able to adjust the weight of each passenger,
take a tip: The rear seats works fine with kids or baggage, it's not recomended to fly with 6 adult passengers, due to balance issues.


Performance

    Maximum speed: 300 km/h (162 knots, 186 mph)
    Cruise speed: 285 km/h (154 knots, 177 mph)
    Range: 1,000 km (539 nmi, 621 mi)

The Yak-58 has a constant-speed variable pitch pusher propeller; so, you can increase propeller pitch to get more airspeed, but with a loss of engine RPM and power.

Cruise: Manifold Pressure to 20-23 and Propeller-Pitch to 0.42

About knobs, use scroll mouse for gross adjustments, and left-central buttons for fine tunning. When setting radio frequencies,
the mouse scroll will adjust integral numbers, and buttons will tune decimals.

Cockpit is a modified version from FlightGear Cessna 337.
